Predicting NCAA player performance through data mining 

**1. Data Collection:**
   - Obtain a comprehensive dataset that includes historical statistics, player information, and team performance for the specified years.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**
   - [ ] **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and errors in the dataset.
   - [ ] **Feature Selection:** Identify the most relevant features for predicting player performance. This could include player statistics (e.g., points per game, rebounds, assists), team statistics, and other relevant factors.
   - [ ] **Feature Engineering:** Create new features that might be useful for prediction, such as player efficiency rating, shooting percentages, and more.
   - [ ] **Data Transformation:** Normalize or scale the data if necessary.

**3. [ ] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize the data to gain insights into player and team performance trends over the years.
   - Identify correlations and patterns in the data.

**4. [ ] Split Data:**
   - Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. This ensures that your model is evaluated on unseen data.

**5. [ ] Select a Prediction Target:**
   - Define what you want to predict (e.g., a player's future performance). This could be player statistics for the next season.

**6. [ ] Model Selection:**
   - Choose an appropriate machine learning model for prediction. Common choices for sports performance prediction include regression models (e.g., linear regression, random forests, gradient boosting), time series models (temporal trends), and deep learning models (e.g., neural networks).

**7. [ ] Model Training:**
   - Train the selected model on the training data using your chosen features as input and the player performance as the target.

**8. [ ] Model Evaluation:**
   - Use the validation set to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance. Common metrics for regression tasks include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

**9. [ ] Feature Importance:**
   - Analyze feature importance to understand which factors have the most influence on player performance.

**10. [ ] Model Interpretation:**
    - Interpret the model's output to understand the factors that contribute to a player's performance prediction.

**11. [ ] Model Testing:**
    - Evaluate your model on the test set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

**12. [ ] Iterate and Refine:**
    - If the model's performance is not satisfactory, consider refining the features, trying different models, or gathering more data.

**13. [ ] Deployment:**
    - If your model performs well, you can deploy it to make predictions on new data.

**14. [ ] Continuous Monitoring:**
    - Keep the model updated with the latest data to ensure its predictions remain accurate over time.
